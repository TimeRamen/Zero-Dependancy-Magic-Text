# Zero Dependancy Magic Text
Excuse the awfully worded title, its 0DMT for short. (Having a short hand form eeriely similar to a psychedelic drug also doesn't help but it's the only catchy name I found that is short and relevant).

0DMT's goal is to be able to:
 - Create typing animations
 - Create deleting typeing animations
 - Create text rotation animations
 - Create jumble-unjumble animations
 - Create a lot more, hopefully.

All while being easy to use and implement the aforementioned text animations (hence the magic text) and having no other libraries attached (hence the zero dependancy). 0DMT is being written in TypeScript. More documentation will come as soon as it is finished.
